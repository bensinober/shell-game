## Autodistill

The next step in effective machine learning by letting machine learning annotate images on its own
and then train on them for an effective, fast and simple model to be used in Computer vision and DNN
(deep neural network).

## AutoAnnoter

Similar computer vision training framework for automatic annotating and labeling images based on pre-trained
neural networks. Supports segmentation and the Yolo (You only look once) version 8.
